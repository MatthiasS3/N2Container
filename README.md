# N2Container  
Is an extension of Container Based Execution Stack for Neural Networks (ConbexNN). 
This project features web services to train and evaluate neural networks using the Kubernetes container orchestration with Java, TensorFlow and TensorFlow Node.js based microservice architecture. 
<!---
## Demo VM
See the project in Action by running a virtual machine. It comes preconfigured with Kubernetes running all necessary ConbexNN services and a neural network training set for testing.
